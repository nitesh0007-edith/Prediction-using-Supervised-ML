### Tasks:- Prediction using Supervised ML 

#### Problem Statement
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### Supervised  Learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 

It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables.
